## Requirements
### Hardware Requirements
- Use the TivaC board
- Use SW1 as an input button
- Use the RGB LED
### Software Requirements
**The RGB LED is OFF initially**
- Pressing SW1:
  - After the first press, the Red led is on
  - After the second press, the Green Led is on
  - After the third press, the Blue led is on
  - After the fourth press, all LEDs are on
  - After the fifth press, should disable all LEDs
  - After the sixth press, repeat steps from 1 to 6
### Implement your drivers
- Implement GPIO driver
- Implement LED driver
- Implement Button driver
